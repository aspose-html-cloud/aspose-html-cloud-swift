# &#10;	Anonymous internet payments using pay phones&#10;    

    
## April 2017

&#10;    Here's an idea for making anonymous payments to a web site for any
    reason.  It works by charnging for a phone call, which can be paid for
    using prepaid phone cards.


&#10;    You use the web site to figure out the amount of payment.  The site
    also gives a phone number to call, and a numeric code to identify the
    transaction.


&#10;    You phone that number from any phone, enter the code, and it charges
    the phone the proper amount.  Then it tells the site that the payment
    has been made.


&#10;    It is not much use to do this from your own phone, since that will
    identify you to the site.  But if you do it with a prepaid phone card,
    using someone else's phone or a public phone, the site will not have
    any idea who is calling.  It will, however, know it has been paid.


&#10;    On a public phone, you could even pay it with coins.
